Part A is rather simple. The first page displays all of the students that are currently in the database by their id's
and allows you to click on them to view their scores or delete them. You can also click on the menu in the top
right to be able to add a student. There is also a fragment in the add student page which allows you to see the 
statistics of all of the grades.

Part B has a navigation fragment on the bottom of the main page which allows you to navigate through all of the 
information about the artist. The main page has their information and you can go back to it from any other page.
